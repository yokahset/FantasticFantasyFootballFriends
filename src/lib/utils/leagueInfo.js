  <p>Started in 2020 by our fearless Commissioner Travis, The Fantastic Fantasy Football Friends league has been the premier Dynasty league for all sorts of gross fantasy management misconduct.</p>
  <p>The league got off to a hot start with its inaugural champion AEffinBerg repeating in our third year, and our annual contender for regular season champion, KCChiefsRepeat, taking the title in year two.</p>
  <p>We've had almost every member of the league make the playoffs, and 3 unique victors in 4 years. We anxiously await our next champion, with many hopeful we see another unqiue winner.</p>
  <p>The addition of Andrew as Deputy-Commissioner in 2022 added much needless technical innovation to the league, like this website. He is hoping the extra fluff will be an added benefit towards increasing league community engagement.</p>
  <p>For any league questions or issues, please contact your local unelected Commissioner. For everything else, there's Mastercard.</p>
